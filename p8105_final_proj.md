## **Project Title**: Elk Expeditions: The Elk, the Environment, and the Evolving Migration in Yellowstone

**Motivation**

We hypothesize that elk migrate due to environmental factors. To
evaluate this hypothesis, we will examine the relationship between elk
migratory patterns and water and soil temperature and chemistry in
Yellowstone National Park. We have chosen to use this data because
Yellowstone National Park has the lowest level of biodiversity loss, and
therefore will have few external factors affecting elk behavior and few
pollutants affecting soil and water chemistry. 

**Intended Final Products**

We intend to create a unified data set of elk migratory patterns and
soil and water temperature and chemistry in Yellowstone national park
from 2009 to 2015. We intend to use this data set to produce an analysis
of the relationship between elk migration and the environmental factors.
We intend to create a dashboard to visualize this data and highlight our
analysis. We intend to publish the data set, analysis, and dashboard on
a project website.

**Additional Potential Data Sources**

Weather Data: NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information
(NCEI) provides detailed historical weather data, including temperature,
precipitation, and snowfall, which would be relevant for tracking
seasonal migration influences. You can access data for specific regions,
like Yellowstone, through their Climate Data Online tool.

Water Quality Data: The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) offers water
quality data through the National Water Information System (NWIS), which
includes metrics like pH, nutrient levels, and pollutants. You can
narrow down data by region and water bodies relevant to the Yellowstone
area.

Landcover and Vegetation Data: The USGS and NASA provide vegetation
indices (like NDVI) and land cover maps via platforms like EarthExplorer
or LP DAAC. This could help correlate vegetation changes with elk
migration patterns.

Streamflow Data: USGS also has streamflow data for rivers in
Yellowstone. Stream levels can affect elk movement, especially during
seasonal river crossings.

National Park Service (NPS): Sometimes NPS offers detailed wildlife and
environmental monitoring data that might include ecological metrics like
fire history, plant diversity, and wildlife counts.

**Planned Analyses/ Visualizations/ Coding Challenges**

We will format the data, produce summary statistics, create geographic
plots, create a dashboard, and publish a website. First, we will combine
the data sets by time and geography, i.e. by time and
latitude/longitude. This will allow us to answer the question: “Where
were the elk at this time, and what were the environmental factors
around them?” We will plot the average movement of elk by time of year
in a histogram. We will plot average soil and water temperature by time
of year in a line chart. We will plot the geographic movement of the elk
on a map. We will plot the variation in geographic factors such as soil
and water temperature and chemistry on a map. We will combine these
plots to look for associations. We will publish these plots in an
interactive dashboard which can filter for individual elk, years, and
geographic features.
